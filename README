SETUP:
* Create an api controller in you application (ApiController would be good)
* in that controller set the $allowed_models array to contain what models you want accessible. These are not the class names, but the table name (ie WildfireContent would be wildfire_content)

USAGE:
* Visit http://sitename/api_controller/help for details
* http://sitename/api_controller/model_table.format?query_string

ADDING AUTH:
* Basic auth is handled by checking for an "access" method on the model thats being used
* If no method exists, then its allowed
* If method exists, then value returned has to be evaulated to be true
